# TYPO3 Extension "news_richteaser"

This extension is an enhancement to the TYPO3 news Extension.

It allows TYPO3 content elements in the news teaser.

## Install

Simply install the extension and include the "News rich teaser" in your TypoScript template.

In the new "Contents" tab you can now create content elements for the teaser and for the main content.
The teaser contents will only be used if no "normal" teaser is present.
